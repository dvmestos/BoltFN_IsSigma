# BoltFN_Linux

Last update: Added a skin generator. Something like raika. âœ…

THIS IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH BOLTFN DEVS, ITS JUST A REMAKE FOR LINUX/TERMUX (remake by gyewtools)

The boltfn checker is in message.py
Remember to add combos into combos folder (same for proxies) in your fork!

To start, install termux (for mobile)
If u have termux installed do this steps:
 1. pkg install python git gh python-tkinter libjpeg-turbo zlib 
 2. pkg upgrade
 3. git clone https://github.com/your_user/your_fork_name (replace it)
 4. cd your_fork_name (replace it)
 5. pip install -r requirements.txt
 6. python message.py

This can be used in Ubuntu, linux etc. You need to clone every time, after putting combos/proxies or updating any sort of ur fork. Too much downloaded things in termux? Go to Termux app info, go to storage and delete cache + storage!

Feel free to report issues!
